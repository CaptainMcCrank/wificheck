# wificheck

This script is intended to accelerate wifi troubleshooting.
WIFI usually fails because you don't have an IP address, DNS isn't working, or you can't route out of your network. 

It's easy to overlook steps.  It's awful to help your friends remotely.  I wrote this in a rage- I can't believe we ask normal people to fix their own internet.  
This script should hopefully help you quickly identify the problem and avoid overlooking anything.  

I wrote it on OSX 10.11.16 (el capitan).
