# wificheck

This script is intended to accelerate wifi troubleshooting.
WIFI usually fails because you don't have an IP address, DNS isn't working, or you can't route out of your network. 

The objective of this script is to consolidate all of the normal wifi troubleshooting steps into a single script.  It's easy to overlook steps.  This script should hopefully help you avoid overlooking anything.  

I wrote it on OSX 10.11.16 (el capitan).
